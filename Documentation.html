        <p class="paraBio" style="margin-bottom: 15px; padding: 20px;"><b>WORKING:</b>
          As the helmet turns on, it sends a telegram message “System started” notifying the user that the miner has turned his helmet on and is heading towards mining
          The helmet starts to monitor surrounding environments and detect for any hazardous gases, dust and temperature rise or fall.
   The helmet also monitors miner oxygen levels and his heart/pulse rate as the pulse rate and oxygen levels reduces as we get deeper and deeper into mines.
      The Led’s Green and redlight indicates miner safety and the data to the led’s from the helmet is communicated by LoRa Communication Protocol.
   The range of transmission is around 10Km radius with the frequency of 455Mhz.
 ESP-32 cam is present on the helmet to have a clear idea of where the miner is heading to in the tunnels. We can take immediate snapshots and also adjust camera from the dashboard
  The helmet also can show the location of the miner using the GPS module. <br><br> The users can know the exact location of the miner using LIFI technology. As the person passes through the each named pole mines, the helmet communicates with the light receptors present at the poles and will let the user know the exact location of the miner.
       Whenever the miner experiences an emergency situation or in a problematic situation, he presses a button present present on the helmet which communicates with the poles and will send immediate data to the user stating that the miner is in danger.
     Whenever miner experiences a landslide the fall detection will be activated and will alert us by turning on the red light using LoRa communication.
